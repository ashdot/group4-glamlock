Increment 1 - 

I used flask to make the start so a note that you may have to download it before running 
Also note that it relies on SQLAcademy so that would also needed to be downloaed 

This is a basic test of the Backend - ( Create Account Use Case )
the connected page is an test.html file using the basic attributes of the person class 


To run this you just click run in vs code or type "flask run" in the terminal of vs code 

When you click on the link in the terminal when you run it should take you straight to the html form 
And when you add the extension /show-users ~  http://127.0.0.1:5000/show-users like this it should show you 
the Name and email of the person in the database as a confirmation the person was stored
